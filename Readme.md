# Tennis Match Predictor
Let's try to predict whether if the winner of a given tennis match is the player with the better ATP ranking.

##Next steps
- Remove insignificant columns from the predictors dataframe (names, ids, etc)
- Add more columns (relative effectiveness as server and returner, days since previous match of each player, maybe bio variables like height, etc)
- Redirect the resulting outputs (graphics, tables, ...) to some specific folder

##Future steps
- EDA, graphs, etc.
- Use a decision tree learning algorithm to obtain a human interpretable hypothesis.
- Principal Component Analysis: convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly 
  uncorrelated variables called principal components.
- Calculate the most significant features, that are likely to have a causal effect on the outcome of the match.
