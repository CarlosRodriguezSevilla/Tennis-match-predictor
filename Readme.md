# Tennis Match Predictor
Let's try to predict whether if the winner of a given tennis match is the player with the better ATP ranking.

## Next steps
- Scale data
- Reshape factor columns with too many levels to fit the models
- Add more columns (relative effectiveness as server and returner, days since previous match of each player, maybe bio variables like height, etc)
- Balance ratio of positives and negatives in response variable for the training data set.

## Future steps
- EDA, graphs, etc.
- Use a decision tree learning algorithm to obtain a human interpretable hypotheses.
- Principal Component Analysis: convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
- Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator).
- Calculate the most significant features that are likely to have a causal effect on the outcome of the match.
